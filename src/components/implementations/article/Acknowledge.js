				By building up knowledge starting from{" "}
				<b>one neuron (linear example)</b>, to{" "}
				<b>
					multiple neurons with activation functions (non-linear
					example)
				</b>
				, it becomes apparent that backpropagation is just our way to
				decide what parameters need to be updated. Unsurprisingly, this
				is salient when we want to tune the parameters to lower loss.
				<br />
				<br />
				Thankfully, Backpropagation is not just limited to these small
				examples, as far as neural networks reach, backpropagation will
				follow. Nowadays, no matter the problem, if there is data to
				learn from, someone will apply a neural network to it (for
				better or for worse).
				<br />
				<br />
				Most Incredibly, through a simple backpropagation algorithm,{" "}
				<i>learning</i> becomes possible.
